v0.3.0:

  * made it so you can do "from magicsuper import super".
  * added "superm" function, which directly calls the superclass version
    of the "current method".


v0.2.0:

  * renamed to "magicsuper"; the "autosuper" name is already used by e.g.
    http://code.activestate.com/recipes/412856-autosuper-to-the-limit/
  * added some more tests

v0.1.0:

  * initial release; you might say *everything* has changed.
